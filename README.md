== MINESWEEPER

This is a minesweeper applet created by me in 2008.  It has a graphical interface and has three game modes.  Custom mode allows the user to specify the size of the field and the number of mines.  Random creates a random layout.  Powerup mode is in beta but provides a set of powerups to improve game experience.

The application also includes a scoring system based upon the number of mines in the field, and the time taken to solve the puzzle.

Open BasicMinweeper.html to play.  Left click to open square, right click to flag a mine.  Goodluck!
